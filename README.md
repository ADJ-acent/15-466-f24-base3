How To Play:

There are 3 lanes, left, middle, and right, which correspond to A, S, and W keys. When you hear the sound cue representing a lane, it means a carrot is trying to break in from that lane! Press the corresponding button and capture them! You cannot hold down the A, S, or W keys at the same time, or else you do not capture in any lane. The cage has 3 health, if it loses all three health, the carrots escape!
